# DL Tasks You Can Perform with RGB Camera + Raspberry Pi / Desktop

With just an **RGB camera** and a **Raspberry Pi or Desktop**, you can explore a **surprising number of impactful Deep Learning (DL) tasks in agriculture**, especially using **image-based inference**. Here's a detailed breakdown of **DL Tasks You Can Perform with RGB Camera + Raspberry Pi / Desktop**:

---

Most of these tasks rely on **image classification**, **object detection**, or **semantic segmentation**.

### 🌿 A. **Plant Health and Disease Detection**

* **Leaf disease classification** (e.g., powdery mildew, rust, bacterial spots)

  * DL: CNNs, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet (TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch)
  * Dataset: PlantVillage or your own
* **Nutrient deficiency detection** (e.g., yellowing leaves = nitrogen deficiency)
* **Stress detection** (drought, temperature, salt stress)

---

### 🍓 B. **Fruit/Vegetable Detection and Counting**

* **Object detection** of fruits on plants (e.g., tomato, apple, mango)

  * DL: YOLOv5/YOLOv8, SSD, Faster R-CNN
* **Fruit ripeness classification**

  * Based on color, shape, texture

---

### 🌱 C. **Plant Growth Monitoring**

* **Timelapse growth analysis** using daily captured frames

  * Use CV to track leaf area, height, or number of leaves
* **Segmentation of plant from background**

  * DL: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, Segment Anything
* **Canopy coverage estimation** (in open fields or pots)

---

### 🌾 D. **Weed Detection**

* Detect weeds among crops for precision weeding

  * DL: Binary/Multiclass classification, object detection
  * For field deployment or dataset creation

---

### 🐛 E. **Pest Monitoring**

* Count insects in sticky traps or on leaves

  * DL: Object detection or classification
* Track presence over time and suggest intervention

---

### 📷 F. **Harvest Readiness Estimation**

* Classify **ripeness stages** of crops/fruits from camera images
* Estimate **time to harvest** based on visual growth

---

### 🧪 G. **Soil and Surface Monitoring**

* Soil texture classification (dry/cracked/wet) using surface image
* Surface water pooling detection (after rainfall)
