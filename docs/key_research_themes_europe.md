## Research and Development Themes in Agriculture using RGB Vision

### A. Precision Farming

Precision farming leverages RGB vision to optimize the use of agricultural inputs such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides by monitoring crop condition at a micro-level. Research in this domain focuses on scalable, affordable solutions suitable for both large and small farms.

#### Subtopics:

1. **Vision-based Yield Prediction and Fruit Mapping**

   * RGB images are used to detect, count, and estimate the size of visible fruits or grain heads.
   * Object detection models (e.g., YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN) facilitate mapping of fruit locations for automated yield estimation.
   * Utilized in orchards, vineyards, and greenhouses for planning harvest schedules and workforce allocation.

2. **Variable Rate Spraying using Visual Weed Detection**

   * RGB camera-based weed identification allows sprayers to apply herbicides only where needed.
   * Image-based classification distinguishes between crops and weeds in real-time.
   * Combined with GPS-tagged vision data to drive variable spraying operations in open-field farming.

3. **Spot Irrigation Triggered by Plant Condition**

   * Plant wilting, discoloration, or leaf posture changes can be captured and analyzed.
   * Image-based stress detection supports site-specific irrigation.
   * Can be integrated with soil moisture sensors for hybrid decision-making.

### B. Autonomous Farming Robots

This research theme focuses on integrating RGB cameras with robotics platforms for automating tasks such as harvesting, scouting, and weeding.

#### Subtopics:

1. **Robots for Weeding, Harvesting, and Scouting**

   * Mobile ground robots equipped with RGB cameras detect crops, weeds, and obstacles.
   * Deep learning enables accurate perception in dynamic field environments.
   * Visual feedback guides mechanical arms or spraying systems.

2. **Low-Cost RGB-CV Perception for Row Navigation**

   * Visual detection of crop rows or furrows allows for GPS-free navigation.
   * Used in intra-row autonomous traversal for scouting and cultivation.
   * Research focuses on lightweight perception stacks for deployment on Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson.

3. **ROS-based European Initiatives**

   * Projects such as ROMI, agROBOfood, and SWARMFarm integrate RGB perception with ROS-based control frameworks.
   * These projects demonstrate modular, scalable agricultural robots for small and medium-sized farms.

   * RGB imagery used to detect symptoms such as leaf rolling, yellowing, or surface cracking in soil.
   * Research integrates thermal and humidity data for multi-modal stress assessment.
   * Focus is on creating early-warning systems for smallholder farms.

3. **Vision-Based Reduction in Chemical Inputs**

   * Targeted pesticide application using disease detection from plant images.
   * Minimizing over-application to improve crop resilience and reduce runoff.
