# Tomato Plant Experiment Setup

This README provides a comprehensive guide for setting up a small-scale tomato plant monitoring and experimentation station using just one or two plants. The goal is to enable deep learning, computer vision, and robotics experiments using an RGB camera and Raspberry Pi in an outdoor environment.

## 1. Growing Tomato Plants in Pots

### Ideal Conditions (Northern India – July to August)

* **Variety**: Cherry or Roma tomatoes (fast-growing, pot-friendly)
* **Pot Size**: 12–16 inch diameter (minimum 8–10 liters soil capacity)
* **Soil**: Loamy soil mixed with compost (60:40 ratio)
* **Sunlight**: 6–8 hours direct sunlight daily
* **Watering**: Once daily in the morning or evening
* **Fertilizer**: Balanced NPK (every 10–15 days)

### Steps to Plant:

1. Fill pot with soil-compost mix.
2. Plant healthy nursery sapling or sow seeds 1–1.5 cm deep.
3. Water lightly after planting.
4. Add a bamboo/wood stick for vertical support as plant grows.

## 2. Feasibility of Single/Two Plant Experiments

You can conduct meaningful machine learning and computer vision experiments with just **1–2 tomato plants**:

### Key Use-Cases:

* **Leaf Disease Detection**
* **Ripeness Classification**
* **Fruit Counting**
* **Growth Monitoring (Timelapse)**
* **Crop Stress Observation (under/over watering)**

This scale is sufficient for:

* Prototyping DL models
* Collecting time-series or spatial image data
* Validating embedded systems or ROS2 perception nodes
